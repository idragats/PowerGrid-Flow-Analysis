# PowerGrid-Flow-Analysis
The Power Grid Model for the Study of Electric Current Flow. Statistical Study and Addition of Parameters.

The generation, transmission, and distribution of electrical energy form an integrated network that is responsible for transferring electrical energy from producers to consumers. The challenge faced by the operation of this network is to supply electrical energy where there is demand, at the lowest possible cost, with minimal environmental impact, while ensuring stable voltage, stable frequency, and high reliability of supply. Based on the above, we understand that the power grid is worthy of study and systematic daily research. The model we used is the Power Grid of NetLogo, which we first studied statistically based on the initial topology, a 'spatially-clustered network,' and then in the modification phase, where we changed the initial topology to a 'Random Network.' We conducted the same statistical study for the two different network topologies and compared their qualitative and quantitative results. The conclusion we reached is that there were differences in the statistical analysis between the two different topologies. Nevertheless, as we continuously increased the number of nodes and connections, we consistently arrived at a certain known adjustment in terms of power flow time, load distribution, and flow variation, relative to the number of nodes and connections.
